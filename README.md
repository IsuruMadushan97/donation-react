# Donors Site
The project is a health donation website where people can list what they can donate and hospitals can choose from those listings. It was built to apply and improve my skills in React and Go

This repo only includes the frontend side of the project, the backend lives [here](https://github.com/ialmoqren/donation-go-api)
